# Dog vs. Cat Image Classification
The purpose of this project is to understand how to utilizize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of Dogs and Cats. In addition to the classification modeling, the preprocessing of the image data is equally, if not more important than the modeling itself.

A total of four models with different topologies were experimented with, pulling examples from an article in Machine Learning Master: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/ to get a better understanding.
